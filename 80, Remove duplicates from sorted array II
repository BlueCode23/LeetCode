For each element i , we compare it with element i-2
if the elements are different, we dont have a group of more than 2 of that element, we overwrite the last non-twice-repeated element by the current read element and we go to element i+1
if the elements are equal, we do not increase i, meaning the current element will be next replaced when we find a non-twice-repeated element
